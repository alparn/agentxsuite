                        The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS): 
                        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>

                    <p>
                        We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.

                    <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG. 
                        However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or 
                        to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this 
                        regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become 
                        aware of any such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we 
                        cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always 
                        responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time 
                        of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation 
                        of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
